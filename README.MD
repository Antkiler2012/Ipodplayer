# iPod Player

## Overview
iPod Player is an Electron-based music player that mimics the classic iPod interface. It allows users to import playlists, play music, and manage their music library with a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- **Playlist Management**: Import playlists from local directories containing MP3 files and corresponding album artwork.
- **Now Playing View**: Displays the currently playing song along with album art and playback controls.
- **Dynamic UI**: The interface updates dynamically based on user interactions, providing a seamless experience.

## Usage
To use the iPod Player, follow these steps:

1. **Import Playlists**: Click on the "Import Playlist" option in the menu to select a folder containing your MP3 files and album artwork.
2. **Format Your Files**: Ensure that your music files and album covers are named correctly. For example:
   ```
   songname.mp3
   songname.png
   ```
   This format is essential for the application to correctly associate songs with their respective artwork.

3. **Navigate the Menu**: Use the click wheel to navigate through the menu options, select songs, and control playback.
